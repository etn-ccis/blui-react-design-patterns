It is useful when you want to block user interaction with the screen (or a section of the screen) while processing occurs.    | [Demo](https://blui-react-patterns.web.app/spinner-overlays)            |
| [Status List](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/patterns/lists)                                | A basic list with status stripes for list items.                                                                                                                                                                      | [Demo](https://blui-react-patterns.web.app/status-list)                 |
| [Verify on Submit](https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/patterns/forms)                           | This type of verification is common when the checks cannot be performed on the client, such as making an API call to verify a registration code, check user login credentials, or search for a device on the network. | [Demo](https://blui-react-patterns.web.app/verify-on-submit)            |

## Running Locally

To run this project (with all patterns) locally, first clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-design-patterns.git
cd blui-react-design-patterns
```

Then you may run `yarn && yarn start` to start a local server.

## Folder Structure

All our design patterns are located inside `/src/pages`.

```
└── /src
    |── index.tsx                           // the root file that renders the application
    |── App.tsx                             // the file for the global layout
    |── LandingPage.tsx                     // the landing page
    |── style.css                           // global css stylesheet
    |── /assets                             // constants used by the global layout
    |── /router                             // the main application router
    |── /redux                              // actions, reducers, and store
    └── /pages                              // individual design patterns
```
